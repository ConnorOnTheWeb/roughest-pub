RoughEst Instant Estimate Calculator allows website visitors to easily and instantly calculate a rough price range estimate for your services.

== Description ==

RoughEst Instant Estimate Calculator allows website visitors to easily and instantly calculate a rough price range estimate for your services.

See the [official documentation and demo on InlandApp.com](https://inlandapp.com/custom-plugins/roughest/)

This plugin adds two instant calculators to your widgets panel:

### 1. Cost Per Square Foot Calculator

- Customer enters two values
- Calculator multiplies them to get the sqft
- Multiplies that number by your cost-per-sqft
- Generates total and displays a price range
- Range is based on -/+ % of the total (ie. 60%-120%)

> ### Example (Cost Per Square Foot):
>
> - Customer types in '10' for both values
> - Sqft calculator multiplies 10x10, produces 100
> - Your cost-per-sqft is 100, 100 x 100 = 10,000
> - 10,000 is the base number used to find the range
> - Low range set to 60%, 60% of 10,000 = 6,000
> - High range set to 120%, 120% of 10,000 = 12,000
> - Price range displayed: $6,000 - $12,000

### 2. Cost Per Run (Single Value) Calculator

- Customer enters one value
- Multiplies that number by your cost
- Generates total and displays a price range
- Range is based on -/+ % of the total (ie. 60%-120%)

> ### Example (Cost Per Run):
>
> - Customer types in '10' for the single value
> - Your cost-per is 100, 10 x 100 = 1000
> - 1,000 is the base number used to find the range
> - Low range set to 60%, 60% of 1000 = 600
> - High range set to 120%, 120% of 1000 = 1200
> - Price range displayed: $600 - $1200
